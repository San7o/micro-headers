micro-headers
=============

MIT licensed libraries for everyone!

*micro-headers* is a collection of high-quality, configurable,
header-only libraries written in C99. The libraries are designed to be
highly reusable, simple to maintain with little to no dependencies,
and easy to integrate in your projects - just copy-paste the header
file and #include it!

The code is cross platform and should work with virtually every C or
C++ compiler. Code style and usage is consistent among all libraries,
so that they feel familiar among each other. Heavy use of macros is
usually discouraged to make the code more understandable.
